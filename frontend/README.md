# ðŸ‘€ Overview

This is the React.js front-end for the eCommerce [web scraper project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyYcSFy3uh8).

The repo for the server [can be found here](https://github.com/pkellz/bright-data-server).

# â–¶ Getting Started
1) Clone this repository
2) `cd` into the 'client' folder
3) Run `npm install`
4) To start the project, run `npm start`

# ðŸ›  Configuration
By default this project will point to `http://localhost:3001` as the backend API. You can change this by either
- setting the `REACT_APP_API_URL` process environment variable to point to your backend and then restarting the project
- or just hard-coding it into the config file (`src/config/index.ts`)
